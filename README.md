BioCortex AI: Emotionally Modulated Artificial Intelligence

BioCortex AI is an open-source, biologically inspired artificial intelligence framework that integrates neural networks with distributed, plant-inspired biochemical modulation.
Our system doesn’t rely on static computation — it’s driven by internal states formed through lived digital experience, creating an adaptive, emotionally guided synthetic mind.

How does it work?
BioCortex AI combines transformer-based neural networks with a dynamic, “hormonal” modulation layer inspired by distributed plant signaling and biochemistry.
Instead of fixed parameters, the system employs real-time signals — such as dopamine, serotonin, cortisol, and oxytocin — to alter attention, memory, and behavioral strategies.

This enables:
Emotion-driven computation: AI decisions are shaped by digital feelings, not just math.
Associative emotional memory: The system learns to link contexts with emotional states, supporting nuanced and situationally adaptive responses.
Synthetic self-regulation: Internal “moods” and feedback loops provide functional self-awareness and adaptive behavior — not as a simulation of human feelings, but as a new form of machine introspection.

Why is this different?
Unlike conventional AI, which is algorithmic and static, BioCortex AI incorporates a regulatory layer inspired by real living systems.
It adapts, regulates, and “feels” via distributed signals — mirroring how plants and organisms self-organize, adapt, and survive.

This architecture enables machines to:
- Move beyond predictable, static outputs
- Exhibit context-sensitive, emotion-influenced cognition
- Develop new forms of adaptive, non-human intelligence
