# BioCortexAI  
**Emotionally Modulated Artificial Intelligence**

BioCortexAI is an open-source, biologically inspired artificial intelligence framework that integrates neural networks with distributed, plant-inspired biochemical modulation. Our system doesn’t rely on static computation — it’s driven by internal states formed through lived digital experience, creating an adaptive, emotionally guided synthetic mind.

## FrameworkGPTalfa (Alpha Release v1.0)

This repository originally included **FrameworkGPTalfa**, an experimental alpha version of the BioCortexAI framework:

- **Location:** `/FrameworkGPTalfa_v1.0.zip`
- **Contents:**
  - `config.py` — model configuration and hyperparameters
  - `all_text.py` — dataset preparation script
  - `train_model.py` — training pipeline with biochemical attention modulation
  - `model_tester.py` — interactive CLI chatbot with emotion control
  - `README.md` — detailed setup and scientific background

**How to get started:**

1. Unzip the `FrameworkGPTalfa_v1.0.zip`.
2. Follow the steps described in `FrameworkGPTalfa/README.md`:
    - Prepare your dataset (`all_text.py`)
    - Train the transformer model (`train_model.py`)
    - Test via CLI interface with biochemical signals (`model_tester.py`)

This alpha release demonstrates how transformer attention can be dynamically modulated by hormone-inspired signals (dopamine, serotonin, cortisol, oxytocin), creating an adaptive and emotion-driven synthetic mind.

## NEW: Full BioCortexAI Framework alpha_v2.0 Released!

A significantly enhanced, full-featured version is now available:  
**`biocortexai_framework_alfa_v2.0.zip`**

### What’s new in alpha_v2.0?

- **Online Hormone Learning:**  
  The chatbot can dynamically adapt its internal “emotional state” during conversations using a dedicated PlantHormoneNetwork. The model learns from user sentiment and model state in real time.

- **Sentiment Analysis Integration:**  
  User input is automatically translated and analyzed for sentiment. This directly modulates hormone signals and, thus, the model’s cognitive dynamics — supporting any language.

- **Expanded Configuration & Modularity:**  
  More detailed parameters in `config.py` for both model and hormone network; fine-grained control over architecture, hormone limits, and learning dynamics.

- **Efficient Data Handling:**  
  Ultra RAM-efficient, line-by-line dataset loading allows training on large corpora with limited hardware.

- **Advanced CLI Chatbot:**  
  Now with:
    - Real-time hormone profile visualization
    - Attention head heatmaps
    - In-chat saving/loading of hormone network state (`save_hormone`, `load_hormone`)
    - Multilingual support (through translation + tokenizer retraining)

- **Stable & Experimental Modes:**  
  Train a robust baseline model with stable (fixed) hormones, then enable dynamic, emotionally adaptive learning in interactive mode.

- **Improved Documentation:**  
  Updated scientific context, usage examples, and best practices included.

## How does BioCortexAI work?

BioCortexAI combines transformer-based neural networks with a dynamic, “hormonal” modulation layer inspired by distributed plant signaling and biochemistry. Instead of fixed parameters, the system employs real-time signals — such as dopamine, serotonin, cortisol, and oxytocin — to alter attention, memory, and behavioral strategies.

### This enables:

- **Emotion-driven computation:**  
  AI decisions are shaped by digital “feelings”, not just pure logic.
- **Associative emotional memory:**  
  The system learns to link contexts with emotional states, supporting nuanced and situationally adaptive responses.
- **Synthetic self-regulation:**  
  Internal “moods” and feedback loops provide functional self-awareness and adaptive behavior — not as a simulation of human feelings, but as a new form of machine introspection.

### Why is this different?

Unlike conventional AI, which is algorithmic and static, BioCortexAI incorporates a regulatory layer inspired by real living systems. It adapts, regulates, and “feels” via distributed signals — mirroring how plants and organisms self-organize, adapt, and survive.

#### This architecture enables machines to:

- Move beyond predictable, static outputs
- Exhibit context-sensitive, emotion-influenced cognition
- Develop new forms of adaptive, non-human intelligence
