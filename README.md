BioCortex AI: Emotionally Modulated Artificial Intelligence

BioCortex AI is an open-source, biologically inspired artificial intelligence framework that integrates neural networks with distributed, plant-inspired biochemical modulation.
Our system doesn’t rely on static computation — it’s driven by internal states formed through lived digital experience, creating an adaptive, emotionally guided synthetic mind.

## FrameworkGPTalfa (Alpha Release)

The repository now includes **FrameworkGPTalfa**, an experimental alpha version of the BioCortexAI framework:
- **Location:** /FrameworkGPTalfa_v1.0.zip
- **Contents:**
  - config.py — model configuration and hyperparameters
  - all_text.py — dataset preparation script
  - train_model.py — training pipeline with biochemical attention modulation
  - model_tester.py — interactive CLI chatbot with emotion control
  - README.md — detailed setup and scientific background

### How to Get Started
1. **Unzip** the FrameworkGPTalfa_v1.0.zip.
2. Follow the steps described in FrameworkGPTalfa/README.md to:
   - Prepare dataset (all_text.py)
   - Train the transformer model (train_model.py)
   - Test via CLI interface with biochemical signals (model_tester.py)

This alpha release demonstrates how transformer attention can be **dynamically modulated by hormone-inspired signals** (dopamine, serotonin, cortisol, oxytocin), creating an adaptive and emotion-driven synthetic mind.

How does it work?
BioCortex AI combines transformer-based neural networks with a dynamic, “hormonal” modulation layer inspired by distributed plant signaling and biochemistry.
Instead of fixed parameters, the system employs real-time signals — such as dopamine, serotonin, cortisol, and oxytocin — to alter attention, memory, and behavioral strategies.

This enables:
Emotion-driven computation: AI decisions are shaped by digital feelings, not just math.
Associative emotional memory: The system learns to link contexts with emotional states, supporting nuanced and situationally adaptive responses.
Synthetic self-regulation: Internal “moods” and feedback loops provide functional self-awareness and adaptive behavior — not as a simulation of human feelings, but as a new form of machine introspection.

Why is this different?
Unlike conventional AI, which is algorithmic and static, BioCortex AI incorporates a regulatory layer inspired by real living systems.
It adapts, regulates, and “feels” via distributed signals — mirroring how plants and organisms self-organize, adapt, and survive.

This architecture enables machines to:
- Move beyond predictable, static outputs
- Exhibit context-sensitive, emotion-influenced cognition
- Develop new forms of adaptive, non-human intelligence
