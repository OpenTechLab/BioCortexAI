# Experimenting with BioCortexAI

This document serves as a guide for experimenting with the BioCortexAI framework. The goal is to explore how different parameters and approaches affect the model's behavior and capabilities.

## 1. Tuning and Experimenting with PlantNet Behavior

Here, you become a biologist/psychologist studying the behavior of your "organism." Change the parameters and observe how its reactions evolve.

### Sensitivity and Reactivity
- **Global Mood Influence**: In `plant_net.py` (the `PlantCell.step` method), try increasing the `global_influence` variable. What happens when the overall "mood" has a greater impact than local interactions? Does the model become more stable or more "moody"?
- **Return-to-Baseline Speed**: In `config.py` (within `PERSONALITY_PROFILES`), adjust the `homeostasis_rate`. What happens if the model returns to its equilibrium very slowly? Will it remain "offended" or "excited" for longer? What if it returns very quickly?

### Memory and Personality
- **Memory Persistence**: In the `AssociativeMemory` class (`plant_net.py`), change the `decay_rate`. How does behavior change if the memory is nearly permanent (low `decay_rate`) versus very short-term (high `decay_rate`)?
- **Personality Drift Speed**: Accelerate the `_personality_drift` rate in `PlantCell`. You will see changes in the model's baseline behavior more quickly if you expose it to specific situations (e.g., only negative messages).

### Tissue Structure
- **Network Architecture**: In `config.py` (`PLANT_TISSUE_MAP`), design a completely different network structure. What happens if the network is composed mainly of `MemoryCell`s? Or if `SensorCell`s are only on the periphery?

> **Recommendation**: Create a copy of `config.py` for each experiment to easily compare the results.

## 2. Evaluation and Measurement

Try to objectively measure how the stateful model is better (or different) than the stateless one.

### Qualitative Evaluation (Human Feedback)
1.  Have several people chat with both modelsâ€”the standard one (without PlantNet) and the stateful one.
2.  Don't tell them which is which (a blind test).
3.  Ask them which model seemed more "human-like," "consistent," "interesting," or "less repetitive." Record their observations.

### Quantitative Evaluation (Metrics)
- **Response Diversity**: Ask both models the same question 100 times (with `temperature > 0`). Measure how much the answers vary (e.g., using metrics like self-BLEU or by counting unique responses). The stateful model is expected to produce more diverse answers as its internal state changes.
- **Long-term Consistency**: Create a scenario where you refer back to something said much earlier in the conversation. Observe whether the stateful model (thanks to its memory and hormones) maintains context better.

## 3. Possible Extensions (Ideas for Future Work)

- **Hormonal Influence on Generation Parameters**: In addition to modulating internal computations, the global hormone state could directly influence generation parameters in `generate.py`.
  - **High Dopamine**: Automatically slightly increase `temperature`.
  - **High Cortisol**: Automatically decrease `temperature` and increase `repetition_penalty`.
- **More Complex Inputs for PlantNet**: Instead of averaging `hidden_states`, a small neural network (e.g., a simple MLP) could be used to extract a more relevant `context_vector` from the entire `hidden_state` tensor.
- **Visualization**: Create a script to graphically display the 2D cell grid, their hormonal levels, and the strength of their connections in real-time. This would be fascinating to watch during a conversation.
